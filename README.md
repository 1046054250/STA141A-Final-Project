# STA141A-Final-Project
# The "Tom-Huang-Final-Project.html" file is the generated final version of my project. To reproduce this document, you need to download the "Tom Huang Final Project.Rmd" and "images" files that I posted in Github. Then, with the data sets in your computer and these two files, you should be able to generate the exact same html file as I have.
